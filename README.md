## Minimal macOS app with two actions

- `Start Zoom`: closes Zoom if it is running, stops immediately if a VPN interface is active, checks the active network, clears Zoom local data/cache/preferences/log state, requests admin access to flush system DNS caches, then launches Zoom in the required sandbox mode with camera/video access preserved. On macOS 13, the app may also spoof and reconnect the active Wi-Fi/Ethernet interface; on macOS 14 and later, MAC spoofing is disabled because that legacy method no longer works reliably.
- `Report a Bug`: opens a small form for optional email + message, then sends metadata plus an attached diagnostics file to the bug report API. A report includes the app and OS version, network interface names, MAC address details, the activity log, and your email if you enter one, and is sent to the project's server (HTTPS only; the log is capped at 1 MB).

## Updates

On launch, the app checks the GitHub Releases `latest` endpoint and prompts if a newer version is available.
